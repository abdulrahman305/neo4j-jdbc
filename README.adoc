[abstract]

This is another shot at implementing a JDBC driver for Neo4j.
It does not wrap the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j-Java-Driver] but does implement the necessary pieces of the https://neo4j.com/docs/bolt/current/[Bolt protocol] itself.
It won't flatten nodes and relationships and will use `java.sql.Struct` for structured types such as nodes and entities.

== Desired features

- Full support for JDBC 4 automatic service discovery of JDBC driver (via service loader)
- Full configurability via url
- No wrapping of the Java driver
- There must be a built-in abstraction for schema discovery. For the first iterations we will use the same or a similar algorithm to introspect the graph as suggested in the https://github.com/neo4j/graph-schema-introspector/blob/main/src/main/java/org/neo4j/graph_schema/introspector/GraphSchema.java#L160[graph-schema-introspector] which is a copy of https://github.com/neo4j/graphql/blob/d9fa063652ddbbd61d14b47debaf1d21be2805b9/packages/introspector/src/to-internal-struct.ts#L50[essentially]
- Optionally translating SQL to Cypher
- logging only via `java.util.logging`

== TODOs

- [ ] Define URL format
- [ ] Implement service loader functionality
- [ ] Research what parts of the Bolt protocol stack from the Java driver needs to be ported / copied
- [ ] Work along the JDBC interfaces to implement piece by piece
- [ ] Define type mappings for structured types
- [ ] Define custom useragent and required infra
