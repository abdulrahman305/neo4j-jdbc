= Neo4j specific syntax for statements

This section deals with conventions for indexing and naming parameters in all types of statements (standard statements, prepared statements and callable statements) and other Neo4j specific syntax.

== Callable statements

=== General syntax

You can invoke stored procedures as follows

Common JDBC syntax::
    `{? = call db.index.fulltext.queryNodes(?, ?)}`
Standard Neo4j syntax::
    `call db.index.fulltext.queryNodes(?, ?) yield *`
Enumerating yielded columns::
    `{$propertyName = call db.schema.nodeTypeProperties()}`
Return (only applicable for functions)::
    `RETURN sin(?)`

=== Named parameters

Our callable statement implementation (`org.neo4j.jdbc.Neo4jCallableStatement`) does support named parameters. As per JDBC spec those are not named placeholders in a query- or statement-string, but the actual, formal parameter for the stored procedures to be called.
We support both the `$` and the colon syntax, that is you might use either `$name` or `:name`.

The assigment `{? = call xxx()}` will be rewritten into `call xxx() yield *`, and `{$x = call xxx()}` will be rewritten as `call xxx() yield x`.

=== Result sets of callable statements

When you execute a callable statement via Â´executeQuery`, you must use the result set returned.
If you just use `execute`, we assume that the underlying procedure does only return one row and you use the getters on the statement itself.
